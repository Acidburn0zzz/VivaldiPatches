# Vivaldi Patches
Vivaldi browser patches

I'm too inpatient to wait until Vivaldi developers implement features that I need so I decided to implement them myself.

Several examples of such features:
  - Show unicode in the addressbar
  - Click on tab to minimize
  - Don't enable thumbnail mode in tabbar when a border between tabbar and addressbar is doubleclicked (ocasional expanding of thumbnails is very annoing thing for some users)
  - Disable tabs cycling with mouse wheel over tabbar (not needed as implemented in Vivaldi 1.0.365.3)

And some more...
